If youâ€™re using a built-in method (`message()`, `event()`, `action()`, `command()`, or `options()`), `say()` is available to your listener middleware whenever there is an associated channel (the conversation a message was posted in, for example). `say()` accepts a string to post simple text-based messages and JSON payloads to send more complex messages. The message payload you pass in will be sent to the associated channel.

In the case that you arenâ€™t in listener middleware for one of the built-in methods or you want to do something more advanced (like handle specific errors), you can call `chat.postMessage` [using the client attached to your Bolt instance](#web-api).
</div>

```javascript
app.command('bold', async ({ command, say }) => {
  say(`*${command.text}*`);
});
```

`say()` accepts more complex message payloads to make it easy to add functionality and structure to your messages.

To explore adding rich message layouts to your app, read through [the guide on our API site](https://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts) and look through templates of common app flows [in the Block Kit Builder](https://api.slack.com/tools/block-kit-builder?template=1).

```javascript
// Sends a section block with datepicker when someone reacts with a ðŸ“… emoji
app.event('reaction_added', async ({ event, say }) => {
  if (event.reaction === 'calendar') {
    say({
      blocks: [{
          "type": "section",
          "text": {
            "type": "mrkdwn",
            "text": "Pick a date for me to remind you"
          },
          "accessory": {
            "type": "datepicker",
            "action_id": "datepicker_remind",
            "initial_date": "2019-04-28",
            "placeholder": {
              "type": "plain_text",
              "text": "Select a date"
             }
          }
        }]});
  }
});
