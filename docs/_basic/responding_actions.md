<div class="section-content">
There are two main ways to respond to actions. The first way (and the most common way) is using the `say` function. The `say` function sends a message back to the conversation where the incoming event took place.

The second way to respond to actions is using `respond()`. This is a simple utility to use the `response_url` associated with an action.
</div>

```javascript
// Your middleware will be called every time an interactive component with the action_id ‚Äúapprove_button‚Äù is triggered
app.action('approve_button', async ({ ack, say }) => {
  ack();
  say('Request approved üëç');
});
```

In addition to using `say()`, you can respond to them using `respond()`. `respond()` is a utility for calling the `response_url`, so it behaves in the same way. You can pass a JSON object with a new message payload that will be published back to the source of the original interaction. Response URLs are covered in more depth [on our API site](https://api.slack.com/messaging/interactivity).

```javascript
// Listens to actions triggered with action_id of ‚Äúuser_select‚Äù
app.action('user_select', async ({ action, ack, respond }) => {
	ack();
	respond(`You selected <@${action.selected_user}>`);
});
```
