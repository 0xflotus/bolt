This guide is meant to show you how to get up and running with your first Bolt app. Along the way, weâ€™ll create a new Slack app, set up your local environment, and develop an app that listens and responds to messages from a Slack workspace.

### Create an app
First thing's first: before you start developing with Bolt, you'll need to [create an app](https://api.slack.com/apps/new). After you fill out an App Name (_you can change it later_) and picking a workspace to install it to, hit the `Create App` button and you'll land on your app's **Basic Information** page.

> ðŸ’¡ We recommend using a workspace where you won't disrupt real work getting done â€” you can create a new one for free.

This page contains links to add features and functionality to your app in addition to important credentials you'll need for development later, like the `Signing Secret` under **App Crendentials**.

Look around, add an app icon and description, and then let's start configuring your app ðŸ”©

### Tokens and installing apps
You have two major options for tokens: user (`xoxp`) tokens and bot (`xoxb`) tokens. User tokens allow you to call Web API methods on behalf of users based on OAuth scopes and bot tokens require a bot user, which has default permissions similar to a standard user.

You can learn more about the different token types [on our API site](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types). The type of token your app needs depends on the actions you want it to perform. But for brevity, we're going to use bot tokens for this guide.

To add a bot user, click **Bot Users** on the left sidebar and then **Add A Bot User**. Give it a display name and username and then click **Add Bot User**.

Now that you have a bot user with permission to send messages to Slack, let's install the app to your workspace.

Click **Install App** on the left sidebar and click the big **Install App to Workspace** button at the top of the page. Once you authorize the installation, you'll land on the **OAuth & Permissions** page.

![OAuth Tokens](bot-token.png "OAuth Tokens")

You'll see two tokens. To add scopes to the `xoxp` tokens, you can scroll down to the **Scopes** section. For now, we'll just use the `xoxb` bot token.

> ðŸ’¡ Treat your token like a password and keep it safe. Your app uses it to post and retrieve information from your Slack.

You'll need your token to use any of the [Web API methods](https://api.slack.com/methods).

### Setting up your local project
If you donâ€™t already have a project, letâ€™s create a new one. Create an empty directory and initalize a new project:

```shell
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
npm init
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted with a series of questions to describe your project, and you can accept the defaults if you arenâ€™t picky. After youâ€™re done, youâ€™ll have a new `package.json` file in your directory.

Before we install the Bolt package to your new project, let's save the bot token and signing secret from the first two sections:

1. **Copy your Signing Secret from the Basic Information page** and then store it in a new environment variable. The following example works on Linux and MacOS; but [similar commands are available on Windows](https://superuser.com/questions/212150/how-to-set-env-variable-in-windows-cmd-line/212153#212153).

```shell
export SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<your-signing-secret>
```

2. **Copy your bot (xoxb) token from the OAuth & Permissions page** and store it in another enviornment variable.

```shell
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-<your-bot-token>
```

Now, lets create your app. Install the `@slack/bolt` package and save it to your `package.json` dependencies using the following command:

```shell
npm install @slack/bolt
```

Create a new file called `app.js` in this directory and add the following code:

```javascript
const { App } = require('@slack/bolt');

// Initalizes your app with your bot token and signing secret
const app = new App({
  token: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,
  signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Starts your app
(async () => {
  await app.start(port);

  console.log('Your Bolt âš¡ app is up and running');
});
```

Your token and signing secret are all that's required to create your first Bolt app. Save your `app.js` file then, back at the command line, run the following:

```script
node app.js
```

Your app should let you know that it's up and running.

### Setting up events
To listen to events happening in Slack (like when a reaction is added, or a message is posted) you'll need to enable events for your app.

Start by going back to your app configuration page (click on your app [from your app management page](https://api.slack.com/apps)). Click **Event Subscriptions** on the left sidebar. Toggle the switch labeled **Enable Events**. You'll see a text input labeled "Request URL".

A Request URL is a public URL where Slack can send HTTP post requests.

When an event occurs in a workspace where your app is installed, Slack will send your app information about the event, like the user that triggered it and the channel it occured in.

#### Using a local Request URL for development
If youâ€™re just getting started with your app development, you probably donâ€™t have a publicly accessible URL yet. Eventually, youâ€™ll want to set that up, but for now a development proxy like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) will do the job.

Once youâ€™ve installed a development proxy, run it to begin forwarding requests to a specific port (weâ€™re using port 3000 for this example, but if you customized the port used to intialize your app use that port instead):

```shell
ngrok http 3000
```

![Running ngrok](ngrok.gif "Running ngrok")

The output should show a generated URL that you can use (we recommend the one that starts with `https://`). This URL will be the base of your request URL, in this case `https://8e8ec2d7.ngrok.io`.

Okay, so at this point you should have some kind of public-facing URL. The request URL is composed of your public-facing URL combined with the endpoint your app is listening on. By default, Bolt apps listen on the `/slack/events` endpoint so our full request URL would be `https://8e8ec2d7.ngrok.io/slack/events`.

Under the **Enable Events** switch in the **Request URL** box, go ahead and paste in your URL. As long as your Bolt app is still running, your endpoint should become verified.


### Listening and responding to a message
Your app is now ready for some logic. Let's start by using the `message()` method that listens to messages in channels your bot user is a member of.

The following example listens to all messages that contain the word "hello" and responds with "Hey there @user!"

```javascript
const { App } = require('@slack/bolt');

const app = new App({
  token: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,
  signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
});

// Listens to incoming messages that contain "hello"
app.message('hello', ({ message, say }) => {
  // say() sends a message to the channel where the event was triggered
  say(`Hey there <@{message.user}!`);
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

(async () => {
  await app.start(port);

  console.log('Your Bolt âš¡ app is up and running');
});
```

If you restart your app, you should be able to add your bot user to a channel, say "hello", and it will respond.

This is a basic example, but it gives you a place to start customizing your app based on your end goal. Let's try something a little more interactive by sending an interactive button rather than plain text.

### Sending and responding to actions

To use features like buttons, select menus, datepickers, dialogs, or message actions, youâ€™ll need to enable interactivity. This is similar to enabling interactivity for events above.

Back on your app configuration page, click on **Interactive Components** on the left side. You'll see that there's another **Request URL** box.

Unless you specified your own endpoints, use *the same* request URL as above (in the example, it was `https://8e8ec2d7.ngrok.io/slack/events`). Press the **Save Changes** button in the lower right hand corner, and that's it. Interactivity is enabled!

![Configuring a Request URL](request-url-config.png "Configuring a Request URL")

Now, let's go back to your app's code and add our own interactivity. I'll break this into two steps: first, I'll send a message that _contains a button_. Then we'll set up a listener that is called when the button is clicked.

Below, I've modified the app code we've been writing to send a message with a button instead of a just sending a string:

```javascript
const { App } = require('@slack/bolt');

const app = new App({
  token: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,
  signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
});

// Listens to incoming messages that contain "hello"
app.message('hello', ({ message, say }) => {
  // say() sends a message to the channel where the event was triggered
  say({
    blocks: [
	    {
		    "type": "section",
        "text": {
          "type": "plain_text",
          "text": `Hey there <@{message.user}!`
        },
        "accessory": {
          "type": "button",
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "Click Me"
          },
          "action_id": "button_click"
		    }
	    }
    ]
  });
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

(async () => {
  await app.start(port);

  console.log('Your Bolt âš¡ app is up and running');
});
```

The value inside of `say()` is now an object that contains an array of `blocks`. Blocks are the building components of a Slack message and can range from text to images to datepickers. I've added a section block with a button as an accessory.

You'll notice in the same `accessory` object as the button, there is an `action_id`. This will act as a unique identifier for the action so your app knows what action you want to respond to.

> ðŸ’¡ The [Block Kit Builder](https://api.slack.com/tools/block-kit-builder) is an easy way to prototype your interactive messages. You can copy and paste the message payload directly into your Bolt app.

Now, if you restart your app and say "hello" in a channel your app is in, you'll see a message with a button. But if you click the button, nothing happens.

Let's add a handler to send a followup message when someone clicks the button:

```javascript
const { App } = require('@slack/bolt');

const app = new App({
  token: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN,
  signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
});

// Listens to incoming messages that contain "hello"
app.message('hello', ({ message, say }) => {
  // say() sends a message to the channel where the event was triggered
  say({
    blocks: [
	    {
		    "type": "section",
        "text": {
          "type": "plain_text",
          "text": `Hey there <@{message.user}!`
        },
        "accessory": {
          "type": "button",
          "text": {
            "type": "plain_text",
            "text": "Click Me"
          },
          "action_id": "button_click"
		    }
	    }
    ]
  });
});

app.action('button_click', ({ action, say }) {
  say(`@{action.user} clicked the button`);
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

(async () => {
  await app.start(port);

  console.log('Your Bolt âš¡ app is up and running');
});
```

You can see that we used the `action_id` to add a listener for our button action. If you restart your app and click the button, you'll see a new message from your app that says you clicked the button.

### Next steps
You just built your first Bolt app! ðŸŽ‰

Now that you have a basic app up and running, you can start exploring the parts of Bolt that will make your app stand out. Here are some ideas about where to look next:

* Read through the [Basic concepts](https://slack.dev/bolt#basic) to learn about the different methods and features your Bolt app has access to.

* Explore the different events your bot can listen to with the [`events()` method](https://slack.dev/bolt#event-listening). All of the events are listed [on the API site](https://api.slack.com/events).

* Bolt allows you to [call Web API methods](https://slack.dev/bolt#web-api) with the client attached to your app. There are [over 130 methods](https://api.slack.com/methods) on our API site.
